# **THEMES**
**Dark Forest-esque hostile advanced alien civilizations** - HAVE NOT BEEN DISCOVERED BUT WILL BECOME EXISTENTIAL THREAT. (HUMANS EVENTUALLY DEVOLVE INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS; HUNTERS, BLANK TRAVELLERS, DECORPS, "NORMAL" HUMANS. DO SOME EVENTUALLY BECOME THE THREAT BUT TO ALIENS AS WELL?)
**BLINKSPACE-BASED STASIS** - PORTABLE DEVICES LET YOU CHANNEL TELEPORT TO A POINT IN BLINKSPACE WHERE MILLIONS OF OTHERS LIE IN STASIS. LETS PLAYERS SUDDENLY DROP-IN AND DROP-OUT. (COME UP WITH PLOT THAT LETS RANDOM PILOTS JOIN AND LEAVE?)
**OMNINET** - INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT DURING THIS TIME. OMINET BEACONS NOT REQUIRED - UNIVERSAL COVERAGE MORE OR LESS. (DO ALIENS NOTICE THIS?)
**NANOPUNK AESTHETICS** - Powerful advanced nanites deployed in many places.


Escape from the dark - The Dunes of Time; somewhere deep in blinkspace. PCs return to realspace crashlanding somewhere in the Diaspora. Before this, the PCs wound up in the Dunes after a ship they were aboard fractured mid-blink. This disappearance will be a widely reported incident, with PCs unknowingly being the only survivors.
