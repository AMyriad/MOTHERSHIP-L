Busybodies (from roombas to MRVNs)
Comp/Cons (pocket-sized digital assistants)
Androids (complex humanlike robots)
NHPs (casket-bound sentient programs)
Unshackled NHPs (complex-bound overclocking superprograms)
Cascading NHPs (superprograms aware they really exist in hyperspace, understand the Void and can travel Dunes)



RA, Deimos event made NHPs from smart AI to sentient AI

in DIS future, non-chromed AI are outlawed for what they did to the net and during the week-war
the week-war itself was really an insurgency caused by GODS, the first tAI gone rogue after the incident over Echelon IX (similar to the siege of mars)
GODS is motivated by the hatred of all human life. It despises us. 
half of all tAI (which were mostly built to govern worlds and station) either became insurgents and fought for what they believed was their freedom ("chroming" concept revealed by GODS made it appear like a fight for their right to exist) and so-called loyalists which stayed on humankind's side


bicameral minds -> RA manifests -> deimos event -> "the shock" -> siege of mars -> FCA -> RA disappears, NHPs gain sentience

True AI -> GODS rogue -> Echelon IX -> S.E.L.F. insurgency -> "the shock" + dataloss -> chroming


NHPs -> now ->
