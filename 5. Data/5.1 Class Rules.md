# **NOTES**
**MARINES**
- Are more likely to hit adjacent targets on a near miss with a weapon.

**ANDROIDS**
- Have no need to breathe.
- Consume power (from power cells, charging units, etc.) instead of food at the same rate humans do.
- Not affected by other androids' trauma response.

**SCIENTISTS**
- Incredibly competent at their subject of study.

**TEAMSTERS**
- More leeway on jury-rigging solutions to problems, and analyzing machines and equipment.
