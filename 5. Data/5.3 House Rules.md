| MARINES    | **WHAT THE HELL IS A MARINE?**<br>Marines are killing machines. Shooty shooty gun gun badasses who verbally say PEW whenever they pull the trigger. People whose main goal on the team is to run directly at the danger alone while screaming your lungs out as you attempt diplomacy with a vibechete labelled "THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR." Whatever your character's actual background (they don't have to have actually joined a military force, just some reasonable equivalent), it's safe to say you have been trained to survive engagement with THE ENEMY.<br><br>As a marine, you will be more knowledgeable on military jargon, combat tactics, and I might be more generous with your failed Combat rolls sometimes. All in all, you are the fighter of the team. You can take a beating. And by Jove can you hand that beating straight back to where it came from. Soldiers, mercenaries, officers, and anyone who knows how to fight make good marines.<br><br><br>**MILITARY TRAINING**<br>Going forward, *Military Training* is a very versatile skill that can be applied to things like: attacking with guns, first aid, tactics, survival, comms, and driving, etc. It has a wide range of uses. What this skill represents is like basic training grunts would get at boot camp and then some, for instance. The thing to note here is that this skill is hard to get if you didn't already start with it, and only adds +10 to rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ANDROIDS   | **WHAT THE HELL IS AN ANDROID?**<br>Androids are machines that can do what humans can't. Computer-minds in humanlike bodies bodies that trigger <br><br><br>Computers in humanlike bodies that edge on uncanny valley territory. Ye who are unphased by most sights that would deeply disturb any sane person, and designed to last a little longer in places your meatbag friends shouldn't. Androids are mobile, versatile machines that can function independently and fit into nearly any role. Because of this, you can consider your "preset" skills as things all androids are pretty good at naturally, while your "chosen" skills are either an extension of what you were built to do or something you picked up along the way. In regards to your background, you can ask yourself like: who built you, where was it, and what did they have you do?<br><br><br><br>Because of this, consider your machine- and chosen skills as an extension of what you were designed to do.  You can think of the most important parts of your background are like: who built you and where, and what were you made to do? <br><br>Anyway, as an android you have a lot freedom in deciding what your background is; like what was your character made to do, and who made them? You can fill just about any role on a team - you're durable, flexible, and computationational like any good robot aspires to be. However you must understand that androids do not perceive things the same way humans do. Opening a door to a slumped cadaver blood-eagled both ways might have your companions face deep in the nearest potted plant, but you aren't always phased by this in the same way they are. For you, you might be observe the floor to be contaminated with viscous liquid at 10°C; vaccsuit at 8% integrity is being worn by unidentified personnel; exterior avulsions detected; immediate treatment recommended, etc.<br><br>But while your status as an equal to humans is certainly something disputed around the galaxy, androids and other AI are vital for navigating through hyperspace. Throughout the galaxy, androids are considered important and valuable staff. Human or not, you're just as valuable. Advisors, technical officers, grunt laborers, and just about any profession you want to ask me about make for good androids.<br><br><br>**ANDROID ANATOMY**<br>As an inorganic machine, you work a little differently than humans do. In our version of the game, here's how we're running it:<br>- *You do not need to breathe.* You won't drain the ship's O2 supply if you're running out, and toxic atmospheres do not affect you either.<br>- *Yes you are waterproof.* No you don't move very fast in it (depends on the situation). Swimming in heavy-G is right out. Go sink like stone.<br>- *You can last a little longer in extreme environments.* Maybe you get Advantage on your first save. Not space though, that shit still kills you instantly. Why? Pressure.<br>- *You do not need to eat or drink.* Instead, if you do not have access to an ample supply of power you will suffer the same drawbacks humans do (see p. 32.5 of the [[5.1 Player's Survival Guide.pdf\|PSG]]). You can find power in Android MREs and Android Rechargers found in restrooms in any civilized place.<br>- *You have blood.* "Blue blood" as it's called. Losing it makes you wobbly. It also becomes invisible to non-android eyes when it dries.<br>- *You process chemicals.* Like stimpaks for instance, poisons too. Yes you can OD. If the drug would tell a human body to do something, your body will usually do the same. Because cryosickness is a bitch and I'm sure some weirdo out there is stimming up their workforce.<br><br><br>**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**<br>AI in MOTHERSHIP//L are broken up into facets; different levels of intelligent computers are used for different things in society.
