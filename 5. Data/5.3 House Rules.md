| MARINES    | **WHAT THE HELL IS A MARINE?**<br>Marines are killing machines. Shooty shooty gun gun badasses who verbally say PEW whenever they pull the trigger. People whose main goal on the team is to run directly at the danger alone while screaming their lungs out as they attempt diplomacy with a vibechete labelled "THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR." Whatever your character's actual background (they don't have to have actually joined a military force, just some reasonable equivalent), it's safe to say you have been trained to survive engagement with THE ENEMY.<br><br>As a marine, you will be more knowledgeable on military jargon, combat tactics, and I might be more generous with your failed Combat rolls sometimes. All in all, you are the fighter of the team. You can take a beating. And by Jove can you hand that beating straight back to where it came from. Soldiers, mercenaries, officers, and anyone who knows how to fight make good marines.<br><br><br>**MILITARY TRAINING**<br>Going forward, *Military Training* is a very versatile skill that can be applied to things like: attacking with guns, first aid, tactics, survival, comms, and driving, etc. It has a wide range of uses. What this skill represents is like basic training grunts would get at boot camp and then some, for instance. The thing to note here is that this skill is hard to get if you didn't already start with it, and only adds +10 to rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ANDROIDS   | **WHAT THE HELL IS AN ANDROID?**<br>Androids are machines that can do what humans can't. Computer-minds in humanlike bodies that regularly trigger the uncanny valley effect. Calculating, intelligent robuts who are unphased by sights that would disturb most sane people, and are designed to last a little longer in places your meatbag friends won't. You, like most machines, were originally built for something, somewhere, and by someone. Maybe you outgrew your original purpose along the way, or you successfully worked off your proprietary years? Whatever the case, if you have an answer to those three points mentioned earlier (something, somewhere, and someone), congratulations you already have a solid background for your character.<br><br>As an android you are a very versatile machine. You don't need to eat, breathe, or blink among things (see below), you're a walking calculator, and you aren't phased by emotional trauma as much as humans. Wherever you stand in a team, you'll always be welcome support. Advisors, laborers, technical officers, and much more are just some of the many valuable stations androids can fill.<br><br><br>**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**<br>AI in MOTHERSHIP//L are broken up into facets; different levels of intelligent computers are used for different things in society. Androids land squarely in the middle on this scale. Not quite on the same level of sentience as Non-Heuristic Programs, but a far cry from the simple networked minds of Busybodies and Subalterns, most androids generally have the capacity to emulate emotions well.<br><br><br>**ANDROID ANATOMY**<br>As an inorganic machine, you work a little differently than humans do. In our version of the game, here's how we're running it:<br>- *You do not need to breathe.* You won't drain the ship's O2 supply if you're running out, and toxic atmospheres do not affect you either.<br>- *Yes you are waterproof.* No you don't move very fast in it (depends on the situation). Swimming in heavy-G is right out. Go sink like stone.<br>- *You can last a little longer in extreme environments.* Maybe you get Advantage on your first save. Not space though, that shit still kills you instantly. Why? Pressure.<br>- *You do not need to eat or drink.* Instead, if you do not have access to an ample supply of power you will suffer the same drawbacks humans do (see p. 32.5 of the [[5.1 Player's Survival Guide.pdf\|PSG]]). You can find power in Android MREs and Android Rechargers found in restrooms in any civilized place.<br>- *You have blood.* "Blue blood" as it's called. Losing it makes you wobbly. It also becomes invisible to non-android eyes when it dries.<br>- *You process chemicals.* Like stimpaks for instance, poisons too. Yes you can OD. If the drug would tell a human body to do something, your body will usually do the same. Because cryosickness is a bitch and I'm sure some weirdo out there is stimming up their workforce. |
