Alright here we go. So our lovely MOTHERSHIP//L campaign follows a bit of a different style of story to what we've made before. **For starters, there is no central map.** The map will evolve and reveal itself as players discover more things. However, important locations/landmarks should be known already. And once something is discovered it will stay discovered forever.

**Secondly, content found in play must be put down beforehand and untouched since.** Let players skip things unless they're have no clue where they're going. Let them run into what's been put down and it react to them. This is freedom of play. No cutscenes if you can help it. At least 2 options of how to do something/how to get somewhere. Make them make tough decisions (like the slow but safe/fast but dangerous gambit).

**Lastly, guide the story into big plotpoints, but how they get there is up to them.**

no central map
map evolves as you discover more things
major locations should be known
our philosophy should be "put stuff down and don't touch it, let players run into it and react to them"
