Alright here we go. So our lovely MOTHERSHIP//L campaign follows a bit of a different style of story to what we've made before. **For starters, there is no central map at the start.** The map will evolve and reveal itself as players discover more things. However, important locations/landmarks should be known already. And once something is discovered it will stay discovered forever.

**Secondly, content found in play must be put down beforehand and untouched since.** Let players skip things unless they're have no clue where they're going. Let them run into what's been put down and it react to them. This is freedom of play. No cutscenes if you can help it. At least 2 options of how to do something/how to get somewhere. Make them make tough decisions (like the slow but safe/fast but dangerous gambit).

**Lastly, guide the story into big plotpoints, but how they get there is up to them.** This is not a MOTHERSHIP campaign. This is not a Lancer campaign. This is a Death in Space campaign. Gems? The void? GODS? The Shock? Tenebris? The Blitz? Absolutely real things that will happen, but not for a long, long time. We're in the prelude, the prologue, the prequels. I can't imagine we'll actually get to play in that setting unless we go through a timeskip somehow, but for now let these "plotpoints" serve as guiding story elements for what we're playing into.
