# **KING OF KINGS OF KINGS...**
Throughout history, through corporate war, scientific breakthrough, and cultural upheaval, there has been but one immutable constant: Union, the galactic hegemony. Luna and Mars, Mercury and Venus. Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus. Phobos and Deimos. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Titan and Enceladus. These worlds strung in their orbit around Sol are the diadem atop which Earth rests, the seat of Union's power and humankind's ancient heart. From Earth, Union presides over hundreds of megacorporations and local powers while controlling the three levers: credits, NHPs, and the omninet. Without these levers, and without Union, the galaxy would fall into chaos.
