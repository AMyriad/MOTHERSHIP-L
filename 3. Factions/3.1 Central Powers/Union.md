# **OVERVIEW**
**ALSO KNOWN AS:** The Bureaus, The Executive Commitee
**LEADER(S):** ExComm (or ThirdComm)
**FORM OF GOVERNMENT:** Bureaucratic Corporatocracy
**HEADQUARTERS:** Earth, Sol System [Centrum Sector]

### **BRANCHES**
- **ExComm: The Executive Committee**


- **UAB: Union Administrative Bureau**
  Union’s largest administrative body is the Union Administrative Department. The UAD is responsible for dispatching administrators across the populated galaxy to act as liaisons with Union’s client states. It receives guidance from ExComm and pushes them as command imperatives to administrators, who then work with local rulers and governments to find a best-fit integration based on local conditions.

  The administrators are vast in number, but a rare sight in most of the Diaspora, as they usually deal directly with local governors. To the average person, administrators are enigmatic, dangerous, and appealing figures. They travel with android or NHP companions (typically embodied in a retinue of attendant subaltern forms), help steer the course of colonies, and are Union; for most people, they are the manifest presence of a ruler that is profoundly distant, if not entirely mythic. The word of administrators seemingly supersedes the will of kings, presidents, popes, and all the rest.

# **KINGS OF KINGS OF KINGS OF....**
Throughout history since the Old Age, through corporate wars, scientific milestones, and cultural upheaval, there has always been and will always be one constant: Union. As is proudly claimed in their museums, Union's founding came at the end of an era - one it brought about itself because of its creation. As the story goes, nation-states and the coalitions they formed spearheaded the earliest days of interstellar expansion. When travel was limited to sublight speeds, and pioneering but to the handful of generation ships ever built, there came a gradual but great shift in capital and power. While ministers and presidents argued over policy and politics, corporations at the forefront of humankind's starward reach grew fat. They were singleminded and driven by only the engines of capital - exponentially growing capital, as from each and every orbital installation, colonial export, and contract came the capacity to sustain more. And at a critical breaking point on the galactic stage, the titans of the market conspired . realizing their efforts could continue unimpeded if they finally broke the restraints of nations that governed them.
