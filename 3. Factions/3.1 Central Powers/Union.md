# **KING OF KINGS OF KINGS**
Throughout all modern history - through war, peace, and progress, there has been but one immutable constant: Union, the central galactic authority.
Luna and Mars, Mercury and Venus. Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus. Phobos and Deimos. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Titan and Enceladus. These worlds strung in their orbit around Sol, and the rest of the Centrum Sector are the diadem atop which Earth rests, the seat of Union's power and humankind's ancient heart. From Earth, Union administrates our society at large and controls the three levers of the galaxy: credits, NHPs, and the omninet. Without these levers, and without Union, the galaxy would fall into chaos.
