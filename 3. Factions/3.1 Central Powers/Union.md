# **OVERVIEW**
**ALSO KNOWN AS:** Bureaus, Centrufascists, ExComm, ThirdComm
**LEADER(S):** ExComm (or ThirdComm)
**FORM OF GOVERNMENT:** Bureaucratic Corporatocracy
**HEADQUARTERS:** Earth, Sol System [Centrum Sector]

### **AFFILIATED PEOPLE**
- ???

### **BRANCHES**
- **ExComm: The Executive Committee**


- **UAB: Union Administrative Bureau**
  Union’s largest administrative body is the Union Administrative Department. The UAD is responsible for dispatching administrators across the populated galaxy to act as liaisons with Union’s client states. It receives guidance from ExComm and pushes them as command imperatives to administrators, who then work with local rulers and governments to find a best-fit integration based on local conditions.

  The administrators are vast in number, but a rare sight in most of the Diaspora, as they usually deal directly with local governors. To the average person, administrators are enigmatic, dangerous, and appealing figures. They travel with android or NHP companions (typically embodied in a retinue of attendant subaltern forms), help steer the course of colonies, and are Union; for most people, they are the manifest presence of a ruler that is profoundly distant, if not entirely mythic. The word of administrators seemingly supersedes the will of kings, presidents, popes, and all the rest.

- **UN: Union Navy**
  The Union Naval Department (colloquially shortened to UN, for Unon Navy) is the largest and most powerful fighting force in the populated galaxy - at least on paper. Subordinate to ExComm, its forces comprise of countless private military groups contributed and maintained by Union's member-corporations.

  Union's Navy is a sprawling, carefully administered organization that focuses on projecting Centrum's power to all corners of Corespace and beyond. It accomplishes this with a (relatively) small fleet of capital- and supercapital-class ships, supported by vast fleets of standardized, integrated auxiliary ships drawn from the navies of member-corporations.

# **KING OF KINGS OF KINGS...**
Throughout history, through corporate wars, scientific breakthroughs, and cultural upheaval, there has been but one immutable constant: Union, the galactic hegemony. Luna and Mars, Mercury and Venus. Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus. Phobos and Deimos. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Titan and Enceladus. These worlds strung in their orbit around Sol are the diadem atop which Earth rests, the seat of Union's power and humankind's ancient heart. From Earth, Union controls the three levers of the galaxy: credits, NHPs, and the omninet. Without these levers, and without Union, the galaxy would fall into chaos.

History recounts Union's rise to power brought about the end of the age of the state. Nations, as the stories in Union's museums go, were 



Throughout history since the Old Age, through corporate wars, scientific milestones, and cultural upheaval, there has always been and always will be one constant: Union. As is proudly claimed in their museums, Union's founding came at the end of an era - one it brought about itself because of its creation. As the story goes, nation-states and the coalitions they formed spearheaded the earliest days of interstellar expansion. When travel was limited to sublight speeds, and pioneering but to the handful of generation ships ever built, there came a gradual but great shift in capital and power. While ministers and presidents argued over policy and politics, corporations at the forefront of humankind's starward reach grew fat. They were singleminded and driven by only the engines of capital - exponentially growing capital, as from each and every orbital installation, colonial export, and contract came the capacity to sustain more. And at a critical breaking point on the galactic stage, the titans of the market conspired . realizing their efforts could continue unimpeded if they finally broke the restraints of nations that governed them.
