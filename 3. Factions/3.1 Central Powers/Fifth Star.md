# **THE LAST STATE**
Millions of people were butchered at the barrel of corpro-state arms when Union's SecComm, or Second Committee, were removed from power by the Coalition. The dream of a new Union - a communal, post-capital society where none were exploited for profit - was dead, murdered by the world and buried in the mud. Those who escaped however, found refuge with an unexpected ally on the capital world of Ras Shamra, one of FirstComm's attempts to grow a new center of Corespace from deep in the Diaspora. There, the remnants of Mazov's revolutionary dream gathered in secret. And while the rest of the galactic powers scrambled to re-establish control, the material base for an uprising stirred until a new fire blazed in the cold and terrible dark: the Fifth Star.
