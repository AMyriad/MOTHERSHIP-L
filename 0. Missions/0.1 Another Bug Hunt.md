# **THE JOB**
**Contractor: The Company**

|                    | **WHAT WE KNOW**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  **10 YEARS AGO**  | The Company detected signs of biochemistry on **Samsa VI** and decided to send a team to investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   **1 YEAR AGO**   | A skeleton crew of researchers, engineers, and marines arrived on Samsa VI to establish **Greta Base** and **Heron Terraforming Station**. Shortly after, the crew reported the discovery a species of small destructive arthropods, labeled them carcinids or “carcs,” and proceeded to terminate them on sight. |
|  **8 MONTHS AGO**  | The colonists captured a carc larva for experimentation and study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  **6 MONTHS AGO**  | *Greta Base ceased all communications.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  **3 MONTHS AGO**  | **The Company** contracted the crew to address the situation. The J2C-I Executive Class Transport **"Metamorphosis"** was chartered.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **3<br>WEEKS AGO** | The crew entered the Samsa system. Greta Base remained unresponsive to hailing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|      **NOW**       | The crew’s dropship touched down on Samsa VI. Torrential rain pours down like judgment day while the colony sits silent as a prayer.                                                                                                                                                                              |

### **MISSION OBJECTIVES**
1. Rendezvous with the platoon commander, 2ndLt. Kaplan, and assist them in repairing the situation.
   - **UPDATE:** They found 2ndLt. Kaplan deceased at Greta Base's comms center; gunshot wound in his skull, revolver in his hand. His body was also notably covered in countless tiny papercuts. However, while many bodies of the colonists were found at Greta, the *Samsa VI Organization Chart* Kaplan was carrying suggests there may still be survivors. **If that is the case, contact should be made with [[SSgt. Underhill]], the presumed now-acting commander, ASAP.**

2. Re-establish satellite communications via the radar tower at *Heron Terraforming Station*, and ensure the terraformer is up and running.

3. ***If all else fails***, at the bare minimum you are to evacuate **[[Dr. Edem]]**, the mission specialist, and **[[Hinton]]**, the android science officer *(or at the very least retrieve his logic core)*.
