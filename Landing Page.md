*It's still in the APC, calm even. The dim red caged lighting of the vehicle's interior cabin flickers every once in a while throughout the drive from a bump here and a pit there. The soothing muffled hum of the engine accompanies the dull pitter-patter of rain hitting centimeters of reinforced plasteel overhead.*

*At the head of the vehicle the well-worn path proves difficult to traverse, but ultimately manageable as the dashboard's nav-map displays the point "HT-02" drawing closer. Likewise, the "H" tracker placed on the dashboard displays a similar point, albeit far less detailed, coming nearer as you advance.*

*The dashboard itself is a smorgasbord of buttons, switches, and dials. From the phone holstered near the comms equipment to the thermal scanner near the driver's seat, Reiner and Halsey are treated to its sight along with that of the midnight road, thick leafy branches passing in the headlights.*

*But for Reiner (@foolishd0g), it's as if something abnormal catches in your periphery. You glance, maybe just for a second, at the radar/thermal sensors as it completes another sweep. There, a single little green dot blinks just in view of the 122nd degree mark - your 4 o' clock. Not quite catching it the first time, you glance again. There, the green dot faintly flickers to light again after the scanner bar passes around to it. This time, it seems to have closed a little more distance to the car.*
