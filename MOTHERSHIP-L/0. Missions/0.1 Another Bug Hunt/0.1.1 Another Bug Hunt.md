|  **10 YEARS AGO**  | The Company detected signs of biochemistry on **Samsa VI** and decided to send a team to investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The signs are emissions from an ancient starfaring race that landed on Samsa VI a century ago. Since then they have slept aboard their ship, slowly terraforming the planet to suit their needs.                                                                               |
|   **1 YEAR AGO**   | A skeleton crew of researchers, engineers, and marines arrived on Samsa VI to establish **Greta Base** and **Heron Terraforming Station**. Shortly after, the crew reported the discovery a species of small destructive arthropods, labeled them carcinids or “carcs,” and proceeded to terminate them on sight. | The arrival of the humans triggered an immune response from the slumbering “nobles,” which began birthing legions of arthropods to protect their interests.                                                                                                                    |
|  **7 MONTHS AGO**  | The colonists captured a carc larva for experimentation and study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Dr. Edem** along with the colony’s android, **Hinton**, discovered that carcs can assimilate other lifeforms using a memetic virus they transmit through a piercing “Shriek.”                                                                                                |
|  **6 MONTHS AGO**  | *Greta Base ceased all communications.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Hinton went rogue, interfaced with the carcs’ telepathic hive mind and converted the Shriek into a Signal that could be broadcast over radiowaves.<br><br>Using the Signal, Hinton transformed several colonists into carcs during a birthday celebration. *Slaughter ensued.* |
|  **3 MONTHS AGO**  | **The Company** contracted the crew to address the situation. The J2C-I Executive Class Transport **"Metamorphosis"** was chartered.                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **3<br>WEEKS AGO** | The crew entered the Samsa system. Greta Base remained unresponsive to hailing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Hinton’s** carcs laid siege to the remaining colonists, who are currently barricaded in the Heron Terraforming Station.                                                                                                                                                      |
|      **NOW**       | The crew’s dropship touched down on Samsa VI. Torrential rain pours down like judgment day while the colony sits silent as a prayer.                                                                                                                                                                              | Hinton has begun a process to awaken the slumbering nobles in the hopes that he may ascend and become one of them. None of the colonists suspect Hinton’s betrayal.                                                                                                            |
